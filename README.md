# PDF Chatbot Assignment

## Description and Features

**PDF Text Extraction:** The text is extracted from the PDF file.  
**Text Preprocessing:** The extracted text undergoes preprocessing, which includes converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation.  
**Text Embedding:** The preprocessed text is embedded using a Transformer model.  
**Indexing:** The embedded text is indexed using FAISS  
**User Input:** The main application takes two inputs: a PDF file and a user query.  
**POST Request:** A POST request is generated with the indexed text and the user query, and sent to the FastAPI endpoint.  
**Response Generation:** The GPT model processes the request and generates a response.  
**Display Response:** The response is displayed on the application.
